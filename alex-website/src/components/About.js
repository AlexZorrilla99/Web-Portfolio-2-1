      <p>
      Having completed my Computer Engineering degree at FIU in August of 2023, I am eager to get out and show what skills I have learned and apply them to the real world. I have worked with React to make this website and another frontend development page, used Java and Python for in school projects and have also learned MySQL to produce database queries. I developed strong leadership skills at FIU by being named the captain of the FIU Esports Valorant Varsity team in the Fall of 2022 up until May of 2023. With this and my passion for programming I am always eager to take on new challenges and continuously expand my technical skills.
